<h3>DATA MANAGEMENT STARTER QUESTIONS</h3>
<p>
	Good data management is fundamental for high quality research
	data and research excellence. Data management covers all
	aspects of handling, organizing, documenting and enhancing
	research data, and enabling its sharing and
	sustainability. Research funders are increasingly requiring
	data management plans at the start of research projects.
</p>

<p>

	The following questions will help you to think about data
	management.  You may be able to answer these questions without
	much effort.  We hope that you begin to see how complex data
	management can be and what it will take to write an adequate
	data management plan.  The Hesburgh Libraries, the Center for
	Social Research, and other units on campus are here to help
	you along the way.
</p>

<h4>THE DATA</h4>

<ol>
	  <li>What type of data is being produced?  Examples include
	numeric data, image data, text, modeling, geospatial, patents,
	etc.   What are the file formats?  Is the data being generated
	de novo, or is it being generated from another
	study/experiment?</li>
        <li>How much data will there be (megabytes, gigabytes,
	terabytes, etc.)?  How much will it grow?  How often will it
	change?</li>
</ol>

<h4>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
<ol start="3">
<li>Who is responsible for collecting the data now?  The PI, the lab, the University, a consortium, other?  Who is currently responsible for data integrity and management?</li>
<li>Who is your funder?  Does the organization have special data management requirements, including the need for a data management plan?</li>
</ol>

<h4>ACCESSING AND USING THE DATA</h4>
<ol start="5">
<li>Is there a metadata or ontology standard for describing your data in your community or University?  If not, is there a metadata standard that you’ve used in the past that you’re comfortable with?</li>
<li>Are there special tools, software, etc., needed to create, read, process the data?  How are those tools, software, etc., managed and upgraded?</li>
<li>Are there any special privacy or security requirements?  Personal-data, human subject data, high-security data?</li>
</ol>

<h4>SHARING THE DATA</h4>
<ol start="8">
<li>Do you plan to publish the data?  When and where? </li>
<li>Who do you want to use it now and later?  Your lab, the University, North America, the world?  Are there any sharing requirements from the funder, e.g., a funder data sharing policy?  How do you plan to handle copyright or data re-use by others?</li>
</ol>

<h4>STORING AND PRESERVING THE DATA</h4>
<ol start="10">
<li>How do you plan to document your project?  What are your plans for managing the documentation?  What tools, software, etc. are you using?</li>
<li>How long should the data, accompanying software, and documentation be retained?  3-5 years, 5-20 years, permanently?  How do you plan to ensure long-term access?</li>
<li>Is there a data repository for your community?  Do you plan to store your data there?  Where else do you plan to store the data, e.g., in the University’s institutional repository?  How often would you like your data backed up?  Should it be stored in several locations?</li>
</ol>

<h4>COST ESTIMATE</h4>
<ol start="13">
<li>What are the estimated costs of obtaining, preparing, documenting
  and archiving the data? Will all of these costs be covered by the
  funder?  If not, how will these costs be covered?</li>
</ol>

<h4>BUDGET</h4>
