        <h3>Why archive and share your data?</h3>

        <p>
        Data management is not just about a plan; it is also about
        executing a strategy that benefits your research objectives
        and the community. Some reasons to archive and share your
        data include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It may be required by a publisher to share and preserve
          access to related data</li>
          <li>Your sponsor ,may require you to share it. Many
          funding agencies including NIH and NSF have
          guidelines requiring you to share your data.</li>
          <li>Your data can advance other research in the
          area</li>
          <li>Your work is more likely to be cited by others and
          increase your reputation within your discipline.</li>
          <li>The University may require you to preserve your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, you'll probably want to archive and share your research as quickly and easily as possible. </p>

        <h3>How can you archive your data?</h3>

        <p>
        Depending on your needs, there are many options available for
        archiving your data both locally and outside Notre
        Dame. You may also deposit your content locally and link to it
        from a community repository, or vice versa.
        </p>

        <h3>Why archive your data locally with the Hesburgh Libraries?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Your data lives on</b>: Your data is always safe
          whether you leave the University or not. The Hesburgh Libraries
          repository will preserve your content as long as needed.</li>
          <li><b>Your data won't get lost or corrupted</b>:You have the peace of mind that
          your data will have multiple copies with regular integrity
          checking to ensure no files get corrupted.</li>
          <li><b>Your data won't become obsolete</b>: Your data can
          become unusable if the format becomes obsolete or the software
          used to open it is no longer available. We will ensure data is
          migrated and preserved in formats that ensure usability for the
          long term.</li>
          <li><b>Your data is more secure</b>: If you need higher levels of security, please contact our team (link here)</li>
          <li><b>Your data can be cited</b>: See the <a href="/data-management/citing-your-data/">Citing Your Data page</a></li>
          <li><b>Your data can be more easily shared and published</b>: Opt to share your data
          with GoogleScholar or other search engines</li>
          <li><b>Your data has no discipline-specific repository</b>: There may not be a community based repository suited for your discipline or the concerns of your research project</li>
          <li><b>Your data may be owned by the University</b>: If the University owns some or all of the data, you may be required you to preserve it locally</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To find out more, please contact our team (link to listserv here)</p>

        <h3>Why archive your data in a discipline-specific repository?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Your community maintains a trusted repository that better meets your needs</li>
          <li>Your data will be archived alongside that of your peers</li>
          <li>Your data's access needs are different from those that can be provided locally</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note</b>: You may also want to link to your data in the Hesburgh Libraries'
        repository to further enhance sharing and preservation. Our team (link to listserv) can help you determine which archival solution is best.</p>

        <h3>Community Repository Options</h3>
        <p>Don't know if you there's a repository for your research community?  Databib is a good place to start.
        It's a searchable catalog / registry / directory / bibliography of research data repositories.  See <a href="http://databib.org/index.php">Databib's</a> Web site.  Our team (link to listserv)can also help you find discipline-specific repositories. </p>

        <h3>Why make your data citable?</h3>
        <p>
        "Without evidential data nearly all research is simply a collection of un-supported assertions. In addition, many data have value beyond their original purpose, either as validation / reproducibility activity or as aggregated subunits of larger datasets. There is also increasing evidence that multi disciplinary reuse of data is occurring more often. In all these cases datasets become valuable research objects and constituents of professional impact." (See <a href="http://sagecite.knowledgeblog.org/2011/07/28/why-do-we-need-datacitation/">"So You Want to Cite your Data"</a>, July 28, 2011, : The Consequences of Data Citation
        </p>

        <h4>DOIs</h4>
        <p>
        DOIs (digital object identifiers) are widely used in scientific publishing to cite journal articles.  They are persistent unique number combinations that can also provide long-term links to data sets.  The Hesburgh Libraries uses this tool XXX to assign your data a DOI.
        </p>

        <h4>Citation formats</h4>
        <p>
        Standards for citing data are emerging slowing.  DataCite has two very simple recommended formats:  <a href="http://datacite.org/whycitedata">Examples of data citation</a>.  Our team can also help you create a format appropriate for your work.
