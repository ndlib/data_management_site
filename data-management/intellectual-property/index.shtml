            the continuing participation in research. At the same
            time, data on research subjects can be shared if proper

            confidentiality.</p>

					<h3>Management of Intellectual Property and Ethical Conduct</h3>
                    <p>&quot;It is the policy of the University of Notre Dame, [...] that the University claims the exclusive right to all intellectual property arising from University Research. Creators of intellectual property have an obligation to disclose intellectual property in the manner prescribed within this policy, to assign intellectual property rights to the University, and to assist the University in legally protecting the intellectual property. The University and the creator share in any royalty income resulting from the intellectual property as described in this policy&quot; (<a href="http://policy.nd.edu/policy_files/IntellectualPropertyPolicy.pdf">Intellectual Property Policy</a>, last reviewed September, 2006)</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The Office of the Vice President for Research, through its Research Compliance Program administers the Intellectual Property policy for the University.  See the <a href="http://or.nd.edu/compliance/research-compliance/">Research Compliance</a> site for more information.</p>
