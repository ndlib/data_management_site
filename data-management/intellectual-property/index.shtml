            <strong>Confidentiality and Human Research</strong>:
            <br />It is vital to maintain the confidentiality of
            research subjects for reasons of ethics and to ensure
            the continuing participation in research. At the same
            time, data on research subjects can be shared if proper
            steps are taken to maintain participant
            confidentiality.</p>

              <li>
              <strong>Evaluate the sensitivity of your
              data</strong>: Researchers should consider whether or

              utilized with other public information to identify

              files.</li>

              <strong>Comply with University policy</strong>:
              University of Notre Dame researchers concerned about
